#### Elevation plane DOF - 
theta1 
angle of the plane in which the arm elevates, relative to the frontal plane. 
0 is when the elevation plane is the direction of abduction
Limits: -45 to 90 degrees

#### Elevation angle
theta2
angle of elevation of the arm in the elevation plane. 
0 is defined when the arm is parallel to the thorax. 
Limits: 0 to 180

#### Humerus rotation
theta3
rotation about the humerus. 
0 is defined when the forearm is in sagital plane (when elbow is flexed 90, and 0 elevation angle, in the neutral elevation plane)
Limits: -90 to 90

#### Global co-ordinates:
Head to Toe: Z axis (pointing in the direction from toe to head)
Shoulder to Shoulder: Y axis (pointing in the direction from right shoulder to left shoulder)
back of head to eyes: X axis (pointing in the direction from the back of the head to eyes)
Origin: Right shoulder

#### Local Hand Co-ordinates
(Wrist NOT included)
When standing normally in resting position, assuming palm open and facing forward
Red: X axis, Green: Y axis, Blue: Z axis
X axis: Outwards from the back of the palm
Y axis: along the direction of forearm, pointing from elbow to hand
